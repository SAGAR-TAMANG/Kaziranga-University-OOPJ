5) create a driver class
6) inside the main(), create 2 objects
7) write the comments while creating the objects - where is constructor? what is the use of new key word?
8) call the function - area() from driver class

    set 1: width = 15.5, length = 10.5
    set 2: width = 5.3, length = 5.5
10) write the results
