1. Write the 3 fundamental components of Java Development Kit. - 3
2. Explain:
a. JDK - 5
b. JVM - 5
c. JRE - 5
d. JIT - 5

1.
- Java Compiler: The Java compiler is the javac tool located in the /bin folder of the JDK installation directory. It converts the source code into bytecode
- Java Virtual Machine (JVM): This is the core component of any Java environment. It interprets the bytecode and executes the Java program
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE): The JRE builds a runtime environment in which Java programs can be executed. It contains libraries and software needed by Java programs to run. JRE is a part of JDK but can be downloaded separately

- JDK is used for Java development as it provides the entire executable and binaries as well as tools required to compile, debug, and execute a Java program

2. 
- The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software package that provides the tools necessary to write Java programs that can be executed and run by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

- The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode.

- Java Runtime Environment is a software layer that is required to facilitatte the communication between the java program and the operating system.
- It basically provides the class libraries and other resources that a specific Java program needs to run.

- The JIT compiler is a component of the runtime environment that improves the performance of Java applications by compiling bytecodes to machine code that the CPU can execute directly
