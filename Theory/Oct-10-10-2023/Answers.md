### Define WORA
WORA is the full form of Write Once, Read Anywhere. Basically, what it means is that, in Java, once you develop a program, it can be run in any kind of operating system. I.e., it is highly portable.

### Why Java is called: 
#### Compiled and Interpreted Programming
It's because Java incorporates both the compiler as well as interpretation stages. I.e., A .java extension file is first compiled into a machine readable code or a bytecode, which then is further interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine, to convert it into the machine language which the system understands. It is different from other languagese which may not ever have the compiler or interpretation stage.

#### Multi-threaded Language
Multi-threaded language is a type of programming language that supports multiple threads (i.e., a bunch of processes) to run concurrently. Java supports the execution of multiple threads i.e., a bunch of processes concurrently/simultaneously.

### What is an API?
API's full form is Application Programming Interface. It is basically a bunch of end-points, can be visualized as a remote, which is pre-specified as what it will perform.

### What is bytecode?
Bytecode is a low level, platform-independent representation of the source code which is the output of the compiler. It can further be executed directly by the JVM or further compiled into machine code.
